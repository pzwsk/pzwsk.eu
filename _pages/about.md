My name is **Pierre Chrzanowski**. 

I am an open knowledge enthusiast and planet lover.

Since 2020, I work for the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en) (GFDRR) where I am leading the [Open Data for Resilience Initiative](opendri.org/) (OpenDRI) and other tech projects. GFDRR is a global partnership that helps developing countries to reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change.

I co-founded in 2012 [Open Knowledge France](https://fr.okfn.org/) the French chapter of the Open Knowledge Foundation.

After a few years as a web application engineer and IT consultant, I spent two years from 2010 at the French Embassy in the United Kingdom to work as a Scientific Attaché in charge of the digital sector.

I studied Information System Management at the University of Technology of Troyes, France and obtained my Diplôme d'Ingénieur in 2007. I also spent one year at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris, France, during the period 2009-2010.

I was born in Reims, France, in 1983 and spent the first eighteen years of my life in the village of [Fontaine-sur-Aÿ](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontaine-sur-Ay).
