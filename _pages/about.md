title: About Me
---

My name is **Pierre Chrzanowski**. 

I publish here my own works and views with a focus on technology, science, and politics.

I currently work for the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en) (GFDRR), a global partnership that helps developing countries to better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. GFDRR is part of the Climate Change Groupe of the World Bank.

I am an open knowledge advocate and co-founded [Open Knowledge France](https://fr.okfn.org/) the French chapter of the Open Knowledge Foundation and [Ma Dada](https://madada.fr/) the French FOI website.

I studied Information System Management at the University of Technology of Troyes (Diplôme d'Ingénieur) and spent also one year at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (No diploma).

I was born in Reims, France in 1983.
