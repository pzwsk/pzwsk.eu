title: About Me
---

My name is **Pierre Chrzanowski**. 

I publish here my own works and views with a focus on technology, science, and politics.

I am an open knowledge and digital commons enthusiast and co-founded [Open Knowledge France](https://fr.okfn.org/) the French chapter of the Open Knowledge Foundation.

I currently work for the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en) (GFDRR), a global partnership that helps developing countries to better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change.

I studied Information System Management at the University of Technology of Troyes, France (Diplôme d'Ingénieur) and spent also one year at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris, France (No diploma).

I was born in Reims, France in 1983.
